### Third resubmission in June 2019

  * In this submission according to a reviewer's suggestion, I have:
  
      * fixed the 'Description' field in the DESCRIPTION start with "Reconstructs perfect ...".
      * fixed the reference in the 'Description' field of the DESCRIPTION file to be of the form: authors (year) <arXiv:...>.
      * added more small executable examples in the Rd-files to illustrate the use of the exported functions (internal functions) and enabled those examples for automatic testing.
  
  * I also updated the version number in the DESCRIPTION file to 0.1.3 to reflect the above modification.
  
### Second resubmission in June 2019

  * In this submission, vignette files were modified to comply with CRAN requirements.
  
  * Updated the version number in the DESCRIPTION file to 0.1.2 to reflect the modification in vignette folder.
